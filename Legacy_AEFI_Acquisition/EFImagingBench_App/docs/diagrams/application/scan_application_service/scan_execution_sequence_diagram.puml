== 1. Scan Creation ==
User -> UI: Start scan with parameters
UI -> ScanApplicationService: create_scan(params)
ScanApplicationService -> ScanAggregate: new(x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, N)
activate ScanAggregate
ScanAggregate --> ScanAggregate: validate parameters
ScanAggregate -> EventBus: publish('scan.created', metadata)
deactivate ScanAggregate
EventBus -> ScanApplicationService: on_scan_created(event)

== 2. Export & Hardware Orchestration ==
ScanApplicationService -> CSVExportAdapter: configure_export(config)
CSVExportAdapter -> CSVExportAdapter: create file, write headers
ScanApplicationService -> StageAdapter: start_scan(trajectory)
ScanApplicationService -> AcquisitionAdapter: start_acquisition()
ScanApplicationService -> EventBus: subscribe('acquisition.sample_ready')

== 3. Data Acquisition Loop ==
StageAdapter -> Stage: move_to(x, y)
Stage --> EventBus: publish('position.changed', x, y)
AcquisitionAdapter -> ADC: read_sample()
ADC --> AcquisitionAdapter: raw_sample
AcquisitionAdapter -> EventBus: publish('acquisition.sample_ready', sample)

== 4. Data Processing & Export ==
EventBus -> AcquisitionHandler: on_sample_ready(sample)
activate AcquisitionHandler
AcquisitionHandler -> FieldCalculationService: calculate_field(sample)
activate FieldCalculationService
FieldCalculationService --> FieldCalculationService: apply post-processing
FieldCalculationService --> AcquisitionHandler: ElectricField(ex, ey, ez)
deactivate FieldCalculationService

AcquisitionHandler -> ScanAggregate: record_point(position, field)
activate ScanAggregate
ScanAggregate --> ScanAggregate: add to acquired_points
ScanAggregate -> ScanAggregate: is_complete()?
deactivate ScanAggregate

AcquisitionHandler -> CSVExportAdapter: write_sample(position, field)
CSVExportAdapter -> CSVExportAdapter: append to CSV
deactivate AcquisitionHandler

== 5. Scan Completion ==
loop Until scan complete
    note over Stage, ADC: Steps 3-4 repeat for each point
end

ScanAggregate -> EventBus: publish('scan.completed', stats)
EventBus -> ScanApplicationService: on_scan_completed(event)
ScanApplicationService -> StageAdapter: stop_scan()
ScanApplicationService -> AcquisitionAdapter: stop_acquisition()
ScanApplicationService -> CSVExportAdapter: finalize_export()
CSVExportAdapter -> CSVExportAdapter: close file, write metadata
ScanApplicationService -> UI: scan_finished(result)
UI -> User: Display completion
